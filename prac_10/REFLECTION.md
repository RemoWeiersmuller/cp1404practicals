Reflection of the Prac 

- My estimates were good. But they could have been better. The main problem is, that i started as soon as I read through the first task. In the future i should be more patient and first read through the whole task and afterwards start with the exercise. 


- 
  - doing reviews: Coding styles can be so different, there is a lot to learn from others.
  - getting reviewed: Don't have too high expectations. Feel blessed if you get a proper code review.


- I would split the project_management task in smaller reasonable tasks with more hints where you can find help (which video). The exercise took me way too long for a weekly prac, and I am not working besides university.
